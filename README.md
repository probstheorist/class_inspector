## Class inspector class
 - Makes writing getters and setters fast
 - Makes the docstrings

### Notation
- `self.public`
- `self._private`
- `self.derived_`

public and private attributes have a getter and setter to avoid rewriting any validation conditions outside of the setters
a derived attribute has a getter but no setter as it is derived from another calculation internally
